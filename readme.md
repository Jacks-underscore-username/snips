# Snips

## Snips is a local package manager, designed from the ground up to work with 'snips' (that's what the saved pieces of code are called) of any size.

### Snips offers tags for organization, a unique namespace for each snip type / language, dependency support, version management, and an extensive search system.

To install simply clone this repo, and run `npm link` to setup the cli, to use run `snips <command>` anywhere, snips is 100% command line controlled, and as such has hints for every step of the way, just enter some value into any field and snips will show all the valid options.
